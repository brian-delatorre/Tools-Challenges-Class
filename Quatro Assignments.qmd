**Assignment #1**

-   Prompt: First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field. Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?

The paper titled “The river continuum: a theoretical construct for analysis of river” by RL Vannote is considered one of the most influential and ground-breaking papers in the field of aquatic ecology. This paper did so much for disciplines such as limnology, aquatic ecology, and fisheries because it defined and gave explanation for so many concepts that are still used to this very day. This paper was revolutionary at the time because much of this information had not been full solidified and many of these concepts were considered a theory at the time.  However, it was still successful due to how it connected many unrelated ecological topics together such as geo-morphology, energy flow, aquatic organism roles, implications for ecosystem stability and so on. This paper has become a staple in many aquatic ecology or limnology classes and has established itself as a defining contribution due to its significance and many researchers still reference this paper to this day for how well known it is in the field.

Conversely, probably the most disruptive paper that has been produced in the last 5-10 years regarding aquatic ecology is a paper titled “Freshwater Biodiversity under threat” (2021, Science). This paper is not necessarily groundbreaking in the sense that this is brand-new earth-shattering information but was held in high regard as it synthesized very important and current topics about aquatic ecological research. Many of these topics involved aquatic species loss, pollution, habitat destruction, and the importance for urgent conservation measures. One can argue that many of these topics are by no means new or groundbreaking, since all of these ideas have been previously been explored and there has been a great deal of research surrounding these topics for several years or even decades at this point.

Disruptive or paradigm-shifting work and how it is related to modern research is a difficult question to answer because I think it depends on what these topics are actually defining. On one hand, I believe that at face value, modern papers being published are not as disruptive or ground-breaking as they have been in the past given the definition that the paper has given us. I would also agree that many of these papers that are actually disruptive appear to be declining compared to previous years. However, that being said it is also worth mentioning that I believe that the overall quality of science has not diminished and that science overall is not slowing down. Rather I think that this has more to do with the nature of science as a hole, and how we interpret and value disruptive research. I believe that given what we know now about science and the scientific method it would not make much sense if groundbreaking research was happening on a regular basis. If new revelations became a regular occurrence, this would indicate that we did not really know as much as we actually did, and that several decades of research on this topic has now been rendered null. Instead, I think a steady stream of research that consolidates and cements several decades worth of research proves that the theories and assumptions we had back then are more than likely the truth considering that they have yet to be disproven given how much time and advancements in technology has taken place since then. Because of this, I believe that one could read this article and think that there is cause for worry regarding scientific research, but instead this should be seen as a good thing as this gives further evidence that science is continuing to head in the correct direction.

**Assignment #2**

-   Prompt: Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?

Thanks to advances in technology, especially in more recent years, scientific computing has really been elevated as new software and programs are constantly evolving and being added to an ever-increasing library. It seems that there is new software or new websites that serve different functions being created on a daily basis. I think one immediate issue that stems from this is that it can be very difficult for one singular person to stay on top of an ever-changing landscape of new scientific programs. This becomes espicially important as many researchers and student already have very limited time as it is taken up by many other pressing matters and may not be able to afford to stay on top of some many new things. However, it is important to realize that many of these newly created programs may potentially become very useful assets further in their career for either accomplishing work more efficiently or tackling the workload in a different way which may prove useful. What this person may not realize is that it might not seem currently worth investing in something new and different for fear of wasting their time. Thus, it is important to note that the barrier to entry is that one first has to give up time and energy in a new endeavor that may or may not prove to be useful. This can be especially difficult if you feel that you have only recently become accustomed to a certain computer program and you are already being asked to switch to the most up to date version.

A good example of specific computing techniques can be seen in ArcGIS users. It is very possible that if you have been using ArcGIS for a very long time you might have been using it early on when it was called arcMap. It then went through several iterations such as ArcGIS and the most current version ArcGIS Pro. It might be very difficult to make the switch to a newer version when you have used the older version for so long. However the consequences of this may be that these older versions will no longer be receiving updates and the entire program may shut down forcibly forcing you to learn the newer version by default.

Immediately the first barrier of entry is learning about this new program. Almost no one will be an expert in a particular computer program when first attempting to use it. Another personal example that comes to mind personally is the use of the ggplot2 function in R. ggplot2 is a very useful and necessary add on to use in R because of how it can improve the visualization of your data. This is an important skill to learn as many times it is preferable to make your data visually appealing if you are to garner attention from an audience in the instance that you are going to present it. However the main issue with using ggplot2 is that it requires the use of different code than what you had previously learned when you were first using R. Thus, in order to even begin you have to learn the basics for using this program and how it has to be used depending on your data. Further, one has to look up specific lines of code for it to appear visually on the screen, which can lead to a lot of time lost. Overall, researcher must overcome the mental hurdle that comes with the uncertainty of learning something new as well as accepting the fact that you might be at a loss because of it.

**Assignment #3**

-   Prompt: We left a couple of questions open-ended in our class discussion today. Please write 2-3 paragraphs addressing how you would handle reviewers of your own manuscript that provide feedback that you simply disagree with and/or contradicts feedback from another reviewer.

To begin with I think feedback is especially important, particularly in academia. With that in mind if I received feedback on my manuscript that I do not agree with I would first take some time and calm down. I think it might be best to rationalize what is going on before making any hasty decisions. I think one of the best things to do is go through all of the comments that the reviewer wrote and see if they are all equally negative throughout the manuscript. In the case that there is only one or two comments that are disagreeable I would try to rationalize why that reviewer said that. Perhaps there is some possible truth to what this reviewer pointed out and due to how it was said may have caused frustration that clouded judgment on an important point. There is however not a good excuse to be especially negative or hurtful, especially considering that there may be young scientists presenting a manuscript for the first time. I think there may be some possible reasons why reviewers sometimes act they way they do regarding giving and receiving feedback.

I think that one answer to this negativity involves how researchers in academia are constantly being subjected to constant criticism as they advance upward academically eventually as a tenured professor or experienced scientist. I get the feeling that many experienced researchers received a lot of criticism such as “doing things better” or “using the wrong methods”, and this perhaps is what changed them to be more critical. This is what I believe drives a lot of these reviewers to leave feedback that perhaps is not the most constructive or appropriate for the author. In some cases, feedback given back to the author is overly critical and seems to only be negative and inflict criticism for criticism’s sake. This I think is a major issue as many researchers seek to inflict criticism onto others as it has been inflicted onto them in the past. Further, many of these older academics have internalized much of this criticism for several years and they believe that this is a true reflection of themselves. To make things worse, many of these reviewers don’t necessarily feel bad about giving negative reviews or how this feedback will make the author feel because at the end of the day they do not believe that a single paper is something worth celebrating about. The older a researcher is the more that he or she realizes that it is always about moving onto the next paper, never receiving any real recognition about the current paper. This I think is also what causes many of these researchers to become jaded and the only thing they have left is inflicting negativity onto others.

This all said I think that if you are placed in a situation where you completely disagree with what the reviewers said, I think that it is fine to do so. I think that while peer reviewers can be considered experts in their field, their comments should not be taken as gospel. It is okay to disagree, and it is important to realize that these people do not have the same expertise as you do. In these cases, you can also see this as an opportunity to make a stronger case for your view by adding more evidence firmly explaining why you believe a certain way. Also, if the situation permits, you could also look for a compromise that will satisfy both sides, especially if this change is minor and won’t affect the overall conclusion of the manuscript. Finally, it is very important to remember that your reviewers are critiquing your work and not you as a person, you should not let your responses reflect any bitterness. Be sure to support whatever statement you disagree with using scientific explanation and citing references from the literature whenever possible.

**Assignment #4**

-   Prompt: Discuss the implications of predatory journals on scientific credibility, public perception, and the spread of misinformation in today's climate of growing antiscience sentiment. We would love to hear about a relevant example from your discipline

Predatory journals have become a serious issue due to their lax nature when it comes to publishing information. These journals will publish any kind of study to make a profit with little regard for scientific concern. Multiple studies have shown that many papers which are lacking in any kind of credibility have shown to effortlessly pass the peer review process and then make it to a published status. This can become a problem for many reasons. In the most obvious case, this can lead to misinformation or disinformation (information that is spread intentionally to mislead and deceive). Basically, the nonexistence of barriers has amplified the spread of negative information since anyone can create and publish anything and pose it as truth. Never has there been so much scientific information available to the public. One of the most important features of science is that it is cumulative. When a study gets cited in an article, that information goes beyond the original source and the situation contributes to the cumulative nature of science. For example, papers from predatory journals have leaked onto Google Scholar and Web of Science where they can be accessed by anyone. The potential impact of predatory journals on the scientific information ecosystem is massive.

An example of a real-world outcome of this happening onto the general public within my discipline has to do with exaggerating evidence that people are overfishing leading to an overall collapse. For example, a fisheries biologist, Boris Worm, in 2006 co-authored a study in Science that argued that if commercial fishing trends were to continue, global stocks were doomed to collapse by 2048. This study has since been retracted. However, when this study came out, media and people alike were calling it “the end of fish”. In this study he claimed that some fish stocks were “60% depleted” and that tuna stocks were “90% depleted by 1980”. However, what he failed to mention was that these low numbers are well within the catch limits set by NOAA. In other words, depleted may not mean harmed and that the public and management should ignore the doom that Boris Worm describes. As a result, scientists are divided on how dire the problem of overfishing is but agree that much of the world needs lower fishing pressure.

All in all, this reveals that when studies such as these come out and make their way to the general public it causes confusion. For example, when this research makes its way to lay people such as journalists and they may struggle with differentiating between legitimate and false information and believe that there is an actual cause for concern. Consequently, the frequent publication of flawed or fraudulent studies will create public distrust in legitimate scientific research. In cases like these, it is encouraged for people to do their own research on the matter, such as looking up what sustainable fish species there are. Weirdly, the truth has become the biggest victim of the modern era, and misinformation has become more popular than the truth. Fraudulent papers are a significant pathway that misinformation can spread. Transparency is an excellent strategy to deal with misinformation. On an individual level, appropriate communication between scientific professionals and the general public is very important. Scientists also have to learn how to better communicate with the general public. Science must be understandable without having to be oversimplified.

**Assignment #5**

-   Prompt: In class we discussed challenges that can arise with collaborations, and Elijah pointed out that manuscript authorship is one place where collaborations can become particularly tricky to navigate. This writing prompt is based on a true story, but the names have been changed to protect the innocent

To begin with, I think it is important to explore the different dynamics between all of the participants in the prompt. If I was a collaborator, I do not believe that Dr. Andrews should be an author on every paper, and I will explain why. Personally, from an outside view, I think it would not be reasonable for her taking credit for work that she did not necessarily do. However, because of how this system works, I think that if Dr. Andrews wanted to, they could author their name of some of the papers published without backlash. These papers would be any of the papers that could be created and published by the graduate students that were brought on board for the project.

The reason I believe this is the case is that Dr. Andrews was the one that originally came up with this research idea, therefore this project would never have gotten off the ground if it had not been for Dr. Andrews. Further, it says in the prompt that she worked together alongside her postdoc and 4 other collaborators to write a proposal that got funded for an incredible amount of money. In my mind, getting the funding necessary for a project is probably the most important step as the project can not exist without funding of some kind. Then the prompt says that while Dr. Andrews did not contribute much after this point in time, her collaborators each hired their own graduate students. These graduate students I presumed are doing the brunt of the project or research as this is typically what is delegated to the lower-level students. Finally, the issue lies that Dr. Andrews wishes to be an author on every single paper that is associated with this grant or project. In my mind I think that if Dr. Andrews wanted to, they could be an author on any graduate student’s paper that gets published. This is because the graduate students would not get the opportunity and the funding for any kind of research if it were not originally for Dr. Andrews and her collaborators grant. If this grant never received funding then these grad students would have nothing to work on. Thus, I believe that graduate students should get no say when it comes to anyone else related to the project wanting to be an author on their paper, essentially since them being here is getting funded by the proposal that helped them get to this project.

Conversely, the prompt also talks about the possibility that Dr. Andrews would also like to be on the papers that I, one of her collaborators publish as well. I think this is where I would have to draw the line. This is because as a collaborator, there is an equal investment that began at the start of the project when the proposal was being written, this is what I believe should make Dr. Andrews on equal footing with all the other collaborators. I believe that she should not get the absolute say for getting her name on any of the papers that I as a collaborator or any of the other collaborators. Further, while she may have had the original great idea that does not mean much until it gets proven in the form of a proposal which Dr. Andrews did not complete solely, thus as it would not be correct for a collaborator to demand his or her name on any other collaborator’s paper, it would not be fair for Dr. Andrews to demand that he or she should be an author on every paper. This is how I would bring up the topic when speaking about this with Dr. Andrews I would simply bring up the reality of the situation and explain how all the collaborators worked together to write the proposal.

**Assignment #6**

-   Prompt: Sharing manuscripts on pre-print servers before they have been accepted by a journal has been touted as one means of advancing open science practices. Discuss some of the pros and cons of this practice and weigh in on whether you have tried or would try pre-printing your manuscripts in the future.

Like many difficult decisions previously covered, the ability to share manuscripts with others can be either beneficial or detrimental when involved in the academic world. Primarily I think it is important to describe the benefits of advocating for open science. First, by sharing manuscripts before publishing, researchers are able to quickly share new findings without having to wait for the lengthy peer review process. This can quickly speed up the share of knowledge which is critical for time-sensitive areas such as public health, where having immediate access to any new findings can heavily affect these areas. Further, through open access and the ability to share information with virtually anyone with an internet connection, people can receive findings even in remote areas. This promotes the idea that knowledge should be available to all and ensures broader access to scientific work around the world. Lastly, by having pre-prints made available to anyone, researchers are essentially promoting transparency with their work by showing the progress of their findings being performed over time. This allows for scientific progress to become more visible at each stage and supports the idea that science is a process and allowing for greater openness between the general public.

Conversely, sharing a pre-print through open access could lead to some detrimental consequences. For example, because pre-prints have not been subjected by the peer-review process these works could contain potential errors. These errors may be methodologically flawed, which could have the potential to mislead readers. This can be especially concerning if these findings, if made publicly available, and can then be misinterpreted by journalists or policymakers. This could lead to unnecessary sensationalized media coverage which can then further be absorbed by the public possibly damaging their view on scientific media. Further, there is a very serious concern surrounding the idea that once manuscripts become public, there is the possibility that authors can possibly lose their intellectual property rights or have data ownership issues as competitors could theoretically use any ideas or findings once they become public. Because researchers are so protective of their data or intellectual property, I believe this is the greatest hurdle to overcome concerning open access to science. Scientists who have spent months or years of research will be very hesitant to take a chance on their findings to be scooped or for them to not get the recognition they believe they deserve.

Overall, the debate over open science is a very concerning topic as there has not been a clear solution to achieve the benefits without facing the negatives. If I were in this situation I think that I would be on the side that supports open science. I think that if I had findings, I would openly share them without fear that my data or findings would be scooped. I think that situations vary across many different researchers so that can make them either in support or against open science. In my case, it would not be enough to simply have access to my findings since my research is more method based and there would need to be significant effort in setting up the experiment for this study. Further my findings are on a very niche subject, so while this information would be helpful in being shared freely, I don’t think there is much risk involved with anyone wanting to steal this information. If anything I think there can be only benefits as I am contributing to an area that has a deficit regarding its research amount.

Assignment #7

-   Prompt: Explain how you would define an "ethical journal."

    The idea of an “ethical journal” is a difficult subject to explain as it can often depend on what the individual believes an ethical journal to be. However, there are key points to consider that can help to address what makes a journal ethical. Primarily, the peer review process is arguably the most important factor. The peer review process or peer reviewers must be thorough and transparent ensuring that the manuscripts that they review are under scrutiny before publication. Reviewers should provide clear and constructive feedback and the journal itself should be upfront about its process whether it is single, double, or open blind. Further, the overall time that the review process is expected to take should be reasonable and well communicated with the author. A proper and ethical journal should be upfront about any article processing fees (APC) and avoiding hidden fees or unexpected costs. Lastly, the editors of ethical journals must be recognized experts in their field qualified and reputable as recognized experts in the field as well as being clearly listed with no sign of fake or unverifiable experts.

    Further, another way that I believe that can help define what an ethical journal is by analyzing its affiliations. For example, immediately you can tell what a credible journal is by looking at its publisher. If the journal is being published by a well-known, credible, and transparent publisher then that is a key way to tell that they are reputable and more likely to be ethical. Further, by checking the aims and scope of the journal itself, it can help you understand if this is a journal that you want to align with. Also, the journal should not claim to publish on a broad range of topics unless it has the capacity to do so. Lastly this journal should have very clear policies regarding its ethics for publication, or conflict of interests. This will allow authors to know that this journal is concerned with these topics and what only what is ethically correct. Further, if this journal is open access, it should provide actual unrestricted access to articles, if this is not the case then this is also a clear indication.

    Finally, a reliable and sure way to differentiate between journals that are ethical and those that aren’t is simply by describing those that do not engage in predatory practices. Since ethical journals should never engage in predatory practices, this is an automatic way to tell if a journal is ethical or not. So like previously mentioned earlier in the semester, these kinds of journals should never spam authors with solicitations or engage in deceptive marketing. Also this journal should not appear on lists such as Beall’s list of potential predatory journals. In summary, while there is no definitive hard evidence for what make some journals more ethical than others, it ultimately depends on the individual and what they believe will line up with their own personal morals. That said, in my opinion, an ethical journal should operate with integrity, transparency, and accountability, these values will ensure that these journals will enable high-quality research and help support the scientific community.

Assignment #9

-   Prompt: Describe a citizen science project that could be applied to your research area. Outline the project's goals, the type of data participants would collect, and how it could advance your research. Briefly discuss the potential advantages of this approach, as well as the possible pitfalls such as data quality, participant engagement, or logistical challenges.

My research involves freshwater sciences, so if I were to design a citizen science project it would involve people being engaged with observing and monitoring the health of their local freshwater ecosystems. The primary goal of this project would be collect data on water quality, presence of certain species, and monitor habitat conditions in local streams, ponds or reservoirs in the surrounding area of a town or city. The secondary goal would be to involve and engage the local community which are interested in water by partnering with local schools and concerned laypeople to help promote the project. The bulk of this project would primarily involve collecting specific water data indicators such as pH., temperature, turbidity, or presence of nitrate. Participants would record any observations using a mobile app with GPS tagging to accurately locate each sampling site. Data would be submitted to a central database for analysis by scientists and shared with participants to promote transparency and responsibility as needed.

To help provide volunteers with the adequate background knowledge necessary for collecting accurate data, there would be training resources available to help volunteers. For example, their could be in-person workshops that would help inform volunteers about proper data collection techniques such as being able to use properly use the tools needed to collect various samples. This kind of training would also help to reduce errors that could arise when taking measurements. Overall if done correctly and if done in the areas of my study which is southeastern Texas, could help my research significantly. For example, having volunteers taking samples such as temperature could help as my study species seems to react negatively and may pose a threat to change in temperature. Further this kind of data collection can happen over longer time frames than would be feasible by professional researchers alone especially in remote or under-monitored locations. Finally, volunteers collecting data about invasive species living in these freshwater areas could be very important. For example, the introduction of an invasive species would be very detrimental to relatively small areas of freshwater, this kind of information would immediately need to be known.

This all said there could be various disadvantages involved when designing a citizen science project such as this. Some problems could be issues regarding data quality among volunteers despite there being resources available to help inform and educate them. This could easily be attributed to differences in volunteers skill levels, certain volunteers simply learn or retain information better than others. Also, since this project is not being funded, we would have to rely on the use of low-cost equipment would could also impact data quality. Further, once data has been collected and sent to researchers, it would be difficult to filter or determine all erronous data points. This could be a serious issue as it would undermine and limit the datum's usefulness. Lastly, untrained volunteers could unintentionally harm the ecosystems that they are sampling such as disrupting habitats. Overall, citizen science projects in freshwater sciences offer significant advantages by expanding data collection capabilties and creating community involvement. However, like many citizen science projects there is always the uncertainty that comes with ensuring reliable data and minimizing potential issues.

Assignment #10

-   If you were an advisor, what steps would you take to support, improve, and maintain the mental health of your graduate students (asking for a friend)?

Knowing what I know now about graduate school and the information on graduate advisers, it would be very interesting to see what kind of steps that I would take to support my theoritcal graduate student. For starters I believe that having a good mood and postiive well-being is important for all person in any kind of work environment. I think that a person's success at work can be closely tied with their state of mind and their mental health. People that are in a better state of mind well tend to be able to focus on assignments that are given to them and also be less distracted by negative factors such as stress or lethargy. For starters I would purposely be invested in the overall well-being of my students. I would try to promote open communication between myself and my students meaning that I would schedule regular check ins that would try to go beyond just their academic progress and try to look for signs of change in their well-being. For example, I would look for signs that they look excessively stressed or look tired (excessive yawning, bags under eyes), as this could be the cause of a much bigger problem. If this were to ever happen I would make time and meet with that student and give them the opportunity for them to say something important that they needed to get off their chest. Also, for any meeting with a student, I would take to take notes during the meeting so that next time when we would meet I would remember what we went over. Having this system of notes being taken would help not only myself in remembering what was gone over, but would also show to the student that I take a genuine interest in what is being discussed.

Further, I would try to acknowledge the student as someone who is a person rather than viewing them as just a student. To do this I think it can be as easy as simply acknowledging small but significant achievements throughout the grad student's journey. I believe this would help with the student's overall morale and help the student realize that their adviser does acknowledge them and would promote positive enforcement. I would try to recognize each of my students as unique in terms of their individuality or mental health. This could be difficult to actually use in practice as many advisers would like to believe that is important to treat people equally and thus it would not be fair to be lenient on some students and then act differently with the rest. However, I believe that tailoring to a student's needs is a form of taking them into consideration and can help each student feel truly understood and supported. That said it is important to note that people can vary in all sorts of ways including demeanor, work ethic, and more importantly their mental well-being. This type of situation will need to be evaluated on a case by case basis and some advisers may not agree with this system or even care enough.

Also, if i was an adviser I would try set an example so that other student can observe and learn from. For example, I would try to set important boundaries such as not answering emails from Friday evening to Sunday morning as a way to healthily manage a work-life balance. I would take breaks from time to time and let it be known to my students. I would explain that taking breaks every now and again is a healthy way to manage stress and if they feel overworked or stressed then it should be okay for them to take a break as well. I believe that by setting an example I would help to inspire other students in doing what is right for oneself and by extension them. Lastly, I would make an effort to always make time for them, I believe that this is one of the most important efforts that an adviser should strive for. I understand that sometimes this is not always possible as many graduate professors are almost always busy and have multiple things to accomplish on any given day. However, by implementing an open door policy and striving to meet with them when they have questions it helps validate them and helps promote communication. Otherwise, students may feel as he or she would rather not bother their adviser for fear of being rejected by their adviser after being told that they are too busy. Overall, graduate advisers play an important role when it comes to a students mental health, and they have an opportunity to become directly involved with improving their time during grad school.

Assignment #11

Prompt: "You're asked to review a manuscript in your field, and when you receive the draft, you noticed that ChatGPT is listed as a co-author on the cover page. Would this influence your perception of the other authors on the paper? Would you have different criteria than if there were only human beings listed as co-authors? Explain your thoughts and reasoning.

The use of ChatGPT and other AI software has seen an incredible boom recently, being incorporated into many different aspects of everyday life in past years. Academic and experimental research is one of these areas that we have seen AI be incorporated into and can be used in different parts of the research process. For a majority of people it is definitely seen as a tool that can accomplish various or strenuous tasks, so it does not seem surprising that people will continue to see increased usage into scientific research as time progresses. However, I believe that an over-reliance of AI tools in research has the potential to cause issues and therefore has to be clearly defined as to how much and where it is being used in a manuscript. This is important to define because at what point in the scientific research is the AI contributing more to the manuscript than the actual human authors? This has very serious implications as re will not see this as very ethical and has the ability to disrupt scientific trust among researchers. In the instance that ChatGPT were to be listed as a co-author, this would immediately translate to me the reviwer of this paper that the AI software did either close to or the exact amount of work that their human co-author did. If I were to come across a paper like this I would immediately be hesitant about a paper like this for a couple of reasons.

For starters, I think it would be important to know what aspects of the paper did ChatGPT actually contribute too? For example, if it is mentioned that AI wrote a large majority of the manuscript instead of the human writers I would be very hesitant to validate the legitimacy of the paper as a whole. If this happened I would begin to ask several questions such as "why did the human author allow for ChatGPT write this amount" or "why did they choose to not write it themselves"? Overall, I see no good justification as to why they would choose for AI to write a significant portion of the paper, as people are interested in hearing what the authors behind the experiment think and their rationale for having the experiment happen in the first place. Further, if the AI was involved with creating the initial experimental study design I believe I would also have many questions. For example, what was the reasoning with having AI set up the experimental design, was it due to choosing an optimal experimental layout or simply because they had the ability to do so? In my opinion, having asked the computer how it would design the experiment if it was in control is essentially the same thing as asking a completely unrelated researcher on how they would design your experiment and using those ideas instead. This is because ChatGPT does not have the ability to create any original or novel ideas and only relies on previous training data that it has been previously fed leading up to when you ask it a question. Thus if you are relying on AI for experimental design then you are simply taking ideas that have already been previously thought up instead of relying on your own creativity. This can potnetially be a problem If left unchecked, since it will result in no furthing of creative insight involving experimental research as previously thought up designs and ideas will simply become recirculated.

The significant traction and the widespread accessibility of AI tools means that AI is not something that will be going away anytime soon, instead I believe that we will all see the opposite and see increased usage in academia whether it is being reported or not. This means that it might be plausible that we will see ChatGPT being added as a co-author or supporting author more frequently in the near future. I think that this may be a problem for many reasons such as loss of scientific diversity and author legitimacy. For example, issues regarding who the author actually is will arise if the majority of the manuscript was instead written using AI. I think that if this continues to happen and creates significant cause for concern there will be more restrictions or guidelines on academic journals that will specifically state how much AI can be allowed to contribute to a manuscript. Overall, if I were to come across two papers that are going to be published in similar journals with the main difference being that one had ChatGPT listed as a co-author, I would immediately be hesitant and scrutinize that paper more for potential issues compared to the other paper. While this kind of thinking may be problematic as all papers should be met with the same level of scrutiny, a ChatGPT co-author will immediate raise several red flags with me as I think it would with any reviewer. Overall, I believe that unrestricted incoporation of AI tools in academic research has the potential to further disrupt the validity and scientific trust among researchers if left unchecked.
