**Assignment #1**

-   Prompt: First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field. Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?

The paper titled “The river continuum: a theoretical construct for analysis of river” by RL Vannote is considered one of the most influential and ground-breaking papers in the field of aquatic ecology. This paper did so much for disciplines such as limnology, aquatic ecology, and fisheries because it defined and gave explanation for so many concepts that are still used to this very day. This paper was revolutionary at the time because much of this information had not been full solidified and many of these concepts were considered a theory at the time.  However, it was still successful due to how it connected many unrelated ecological topics together such as geo-morphology, energy flow, aquatic organism roles, implications for ecosystem stability and so on. This paper has become a staple in many aquatic ecology or limnology classes and has established itself as a defining contribution due to its significance and many researchers still reference this paper to this day for how well known it is in the field.

Conversely, probably the most disruptive paper that has been produced in the last 5-10 years regarding aquatic ecology is a paper titled “Freshwater Biodiversity under threat” (2021, Science). This paper is not necessarily groundbreaking in the sense that this is brand-new earth-shattering information but was held in high regard as it synthesized very important and current topics about aquatic ecological research. Many of these topics involved aquatic species loss, pollution, habitat destruction, and the importance for urgent conservation measures. One can argue that many of these topics are by no means new or groundbreaking, since all of these ideas have been previously been explored and there has been a great deal of research surrounding these topics for several years or even decades at this point.

Disruptive or paradigm-shifting work and how it is related to modern research is a difficult question to answer because I think it depends on what these topics are actually defining. On one hand, I believe that at face value, modern papers being published are not as disruptive or ground-breaking as they have been in the past given the definition that the paper has given us. I would also agree that many of these papers that are actually disruptive appear to be declining compared to previous years. However, that being said it is also worth mentioning that I believe that the overall quality of science has not diminished and that science overall is not slowing down. Rather I think that this has more to do with the nature of science as a hole, and how we interpret and value disruptive research. I believe that given what we know now about science and the scientific method it would not make much sense if groundbreaking research was happening on a regular basis. If new revelations became a regular occurrence, this would indicate that we did not really know as much as we actually did, and that several decades of research on this topic has now been rendered null. Instead, I think a steady stream of research that consolidates and cements several decades worth of research proves that the theories and assumptions we had back then are more than likely the truth considering that they have yet to be disproven given how much time and advancements in technology has taken place since then. Because of this, I believe that one could read this article and think that there is cause for worry regarding scientific research, but instead this should be seen as a good thing as this gives further evidence that science is continuing to head in the correct direction.

**Assignment #2**

-   Prompt: Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?

Thanks to advances in technology, especially in more recent years, scientific computing has really been elevated as new software and programs are constantly evolving and being added to an ever-increasing library. It seems that there is new software or new websites that serve different functions being created on a daily basis. I think one immediate issue that stems from this is that it can be very difficult for one singular person to stay on top of an ever-changing landscape of new scientific programs. This becomes espicially important as many researchers and student already have very limited time as it is taken up by many other pressing matters and may not be able to afford to stay on top of some many new things. However, it is important to realize that many of these newly created programs may potentially become very useful assets further in their career for either accomplishing work more efficiently or tackling the workload in a different way which may prove useful. What this person may not realize is that it might not seem currently worth investing in something new and different for fear of wasting their time. Thus, it is important to note that the barrier to entry is that one first has to give up time and energy in a new endeavor that may or may not prove to be useful. This can be especially difficult if you feel that you have only recently become accustomed to a certain computer program and you are already being asked to switch to the most up to date version.

A good example of specific computing techniques can be seen in ArcGIS users. It is very possible that if you have been using ArcGIS for a very long time you might have been using it early on when it was called arcMap. It then went through several iterations such as ArcGIS and the most current version ArcGIS Pro. It might be very difficult to make the switch to a newer version when you have used the older version for so long. However the consequences of this may be that these older versions will no longer be receiving updates and the entire program may shut down forcibly forcing you to learn the newer version by default.

Immediately the first barrier of entry is learning about this new program. Almost no one will be an expert in a particular computer program when first attempting to use it. Another personal example that comes to mind personally is the use of the ggplot2 function in R. ggplot2 is a very useful and necessary add on to use in R because of how it can improve the visualization of your data. This is an important skill to learn as many times it is preferable to make your data visually appealing if you are to garner attention from an audience in the instance that you are going to present it. However the main issue with using ggplot2 is that it requires the use of different code than what you had previously learned when you were first using R. Thus, in order to even begin you have to learn the basics for using this program and how it has to be used depending on your data. Further, one has to look up specific lines of code for it to appear visually on the screen, which can lead to a lot of time lost. Overall, researcher must overcome the mental hurdle that comes with the uncertainty of learning something new as well as accepting the fact that you might be at a loss because of it.
